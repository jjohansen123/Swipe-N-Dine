        <b>Our Project:</b> \n
        Our team is David Jia, Coleman Johnston
        and Joakim Johansen. We built this app using
        Android SDK and Firebase API to store
        in a database. We use the Yelp Fusion API
        to get information about different restaurants
        and the Firebase Facebook API to get the log in. \n \n
        <b>Deliverables:</b>\n
        We aim to build an Android application that assists users in
        finding a restaurant to eat at by providing an interface
        similar to tinder. The app will show the user pictures of
        food then supply matches based on the dishes that the user
        approved of. Essentially we hope to provide a tinder for that
        matches people with restaurant instead of other people. \n \n
        <b>Motivation:</b> \n
        It can be exceptionally difficult to decide on a place to eat
        especially if one does not have a specific craving at the time,
        and Yelp only provides filters so it cannot choose a restaurant
        for you.
